Hooks lets you define hooks declaratively in your ruby class.
You can add callbacks to your hook, which will be run as soon as
you run the hook!

It's almost like ActiveSupport::Callbacks but 76,6% less complex.
Instead, it is not more than a few lines of code, one method compilation,
no method_missing and no magic.

Also, you may pass additional arguments to your callbacks when invoking a hook.
