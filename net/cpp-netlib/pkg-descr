The project aims to build upon the latest C++ standard (currently C++11) to
provide easy to use libraries for network programming.
We use the latest compiler versions and features with an eye on pushing the
boundaries on leveraging what's available in C++.

Currently the library contains an HTTP client and server implementation,
a stand-alone URI library, a network message framework,
and some concurrency tools.

The project welcomes contributions from people interested in joining the effort.
See the section on Project Policies for more information on getting involved.
